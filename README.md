importing ;
start by importing the csv files :

Open and run each query for each question from the analysis_queries.sql file. Outputs of each queries are saved under the employee_analysis folder. Alternatively, you can also lookup the results via Jupyter Notebook file data_analysis.ipynb. Refer to the next section for setting up the config.py file before running data_analysis.ipynb.
